# Digital Screen Time Analysis and Well-Being Correlation

This project aims to analyze the effect of digital screen time (computers, smartphones, TV, video games) on the well-being of adolescents using real-world datasets. The analysis covers both descriptive and inferential statistical methods to gain insights into screen time usage patterns and their correlation with well-being metrics. The study leverages data science tools to highlight the potential impacts of high screen time on psychological symptoms and behavioural outcomes.

## Objectives:
1. Descriptive Analysis:
Explored the demographic factors (gender, minority status, deprivation index) influencing screen time.
Analyzed how well-being indicators differ based on screen time across weekdays and weekends.

2. Inferential Analysis:
Performed hypothesis testing to determine if there is a significant difference in well-being scores between high and low screen time users.
Build a regression model to predict the impact of screen time and demographic factors on specific well-being indicators.
