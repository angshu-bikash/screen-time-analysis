# Digital Screen Time Analysis and Well-Being Correlation


This project aims to analyze the effect of digital screen time on the well-being of adolescents using real-world datasets. By applying data science techniques, we investigate how screen time across various devices (computers, smartphones, TV, video games) affects self-reported well-being indicators such as optimism, cheerfulness, and overall mental health.

The analysis covers both descriptive and inferential statistical methods to gain insights into screen time usage patterns and their correlation with well-being metrics. The study leverages data science tools to highlight the potential impacts of high screen time on psychological symptoms and behavioural outcomes.


## Objectives:

1. Descriptive Analysis:
Explored the demographic factors (gender, minority status, deprivation index) influencing screen time.
Analyzed how well-being indicators differ based on screen time across weekdays and weekends.

2. Inferential Analysis:
Performed hypothesis testing to determine if there is a significant difference in well-being scores between high and low screen time users.
Build a regression model to predict the impact of screen time and demographic factors on specific well-being indicators.
Data Visualization:

Used visual tools to clearly present relationships between screen time and well-being scores.

### Deliverables:
High-quality recorded presentation explaining the findings, justification of analysis methods, and final conclusions.
