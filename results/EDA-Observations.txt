1. Gender Distribution
Mean gender value: 0.47 (where 0 is female and 1 is male, based on your prior boxplot)
This means the dataset is fairly balanced between males and females, with about 47% male respondents.

2. Screen Time (Weekdays and Weekends)
Here’s a breakdown of the statistics for screen time across different devices and days:

C_we (Computer time on weekends): Mean = 2.2 hours, Std = 2.07 hours
C_wk (Computer time on weekdays): Mean = 1.77 hours, Std = 1.72 hours
G_we (Video games on weekends): Mean = 1.73 hours, Std = 2.16 hours
G_wk (Video games on weekdays): Mean = 1 hour, Std = 1.54 hours
S_we (Smartphone time on weekends): Mean = 3.5 hours, Std = 2.49 hours
S_wk (Smartphone time on weekdays): Mean = 2.89 hours, Std = 2.32 hours
T_we (TV on weekends): Mean = 3.65 hours, Std = 1.94 hours
T_wk (TV on weekdays): Mean = 2.55 hours, Std = 1.69 hours

Weekend vs Weekday: Screen time across all devices is higher on weekends compared to weekdays (as expected).
Smartphone usage is highest overall compared to other types of screen time, particularly on weekends (mean of 3.5 hours on weekends vs 2.9 hours on weekdays).
Video games show high variability, with some respondents playing for as long as 7 hours, particularly on weekends, reflecting significant diversity in gaming behavior.


3. Well-being Indicators (1-5 scale)
The well-being scores, based on a scale from 1 to 5, show some interesting patterns across different emotions.

Central Tendencies:
Optimism (Optm): Mean = 3.28, Std = 1.00
Cheerfulness (Cheer): Mean = 3.50, Std = 1.01
Feeling loved (Loved): Mean = 3.85, Std = 0.97
Feeling relaxed (Relx): Mean = 3.10, Std = 1.01
Dealing with problems well (Dealpr): Mean = 3.37, Std = 1.05
Feeling confident (Conf): Mean = 3.56, Std = 1.03



Key Observations:

Neutrality of Scores: Most well-being indicators have a mean close to 3 (the middle of the 1-5 scale), suggesting that respondents are generally neutral in their well-being.
Exception: Loved (Mean = 3.85): The "Feeling loved" indicator stands out with a higher mean score compared to the other indicators.
This suggests that most respondents feel a strong sense of being loved.
Lower Scores: Relaxation (Mean = 3.1): The "Feeling relaxed" indicator is lower compared to others, which could suggest that many respondents are experiencing stress or difficulty in feeling calm.

Standard Deviations:
Most well-being indicators have a standard deviation close to 1, indicating a relatively wide spread of responses across the scale, with some respondents feeling very positive and others feeling quite negative.


High Feeling Loved but Low Relaxation: There’s a contrast between the high feeling of being loved (Mean = 3.85) and the lower levels of relaxation (Mean = 3.1).
This could indicate that even though adolescents feel supported emotionally, they may still experience stress, possibly due to academic pressure, social media, or screen time itself.
